# 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences
# Easy
# Topics
# Companies
# Hint
# Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
# Example 2:

# Input: arr = [1,2]
# Output: false
# Example 3:

# Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
# Output: true
#

    for val in counts.values():

    		return False

    	occurence.add(val)
